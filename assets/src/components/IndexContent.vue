      SimpleInventory is an open source inventory management application for the small scale.
      It can be used for managing small inventories of different instititions. I built this application,
      because I want to use it on my own purpose. Furthermore, I already built an inventory system about
      an year ago and I wanted to see, how big my progress in learing about professional software 
      development has been forwarded.
